# Pokedex with React JS y pokeAPI

_It's my first React project so there are bound to be bugs but I did my best to apply what I've learned_

This project was created using the React JS library and the API provided by pokeAPI.

Its functionality is to list and display the pokemon (in batches of 6 pokemon) with their respective data such as their name, type, weight, height, skills and statistics.

To create this project I use:

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [Vercel for deploy](https://vercel.com/)
